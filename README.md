genetic algorithm optimization in Go

### Knapsack Problem

The zero-one knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. We try to pack a knapsack with
items that maximize value while keeping the weight under some limit. The search space is 2<sup>n</sup>
where n is the number of items.


### Satisfiability problems

* MAX-SAT is the problem of determining the maximum number of clauses that boolean formula can satisfy. MAX-SAT is NP-hard

### Bounded Function Optimization

* One-dimensional function optimization
* Two-dimensional function optimization
